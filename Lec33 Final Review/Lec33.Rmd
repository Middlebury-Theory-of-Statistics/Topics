## Final Details

* Friday May 20th 2016 8:30-12:30.
* Will be posted on class GitHub at 8:30am.
* Open-book, but **only** materials from this class.
* You must
    + Submit print-out to me in my office by 12:40pm.
    + Email me the `.Rmd` file for any code in an email with subject "MATH311 Final YOUR NAME"




## Studying Tips

* Final is worth 25%, whereas midterms were 20% each: don't think of this as a
final per se, but think of it as a 4th midterm.
* Go over all material to get concepts.
* Go over `.Rmd` files of HW's in fine detail.
* Exam will focus both on
    + How to code a result
    + What does the result mean







## HW 9

* How do I interpret the
[table](https://github.com/Middlebury-Theory-of-Statistics/Non-Public/blob/master/HW09/conf_ints.pdf)
of red/yellow/green? What do the results mean?





## HW 10

* More operational in terms of code. But what do the results/output mean?





## HW 11

* Logistic Regression
* Bootstrap/permutation regression. Not done so much in practice, but what
concepts are we trying to reinforce here?
* Bayesian statistics from last week.
