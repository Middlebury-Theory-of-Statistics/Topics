## Notecard Question 1

What do you think is the ratio of mean heights of men and mean heights of women
in the San Francisco?





## Paired Data

Say we have the price of about 70 textbooks at the UCLA bookstore vs Amazon.
There is an obvious pairing between observations in the two samples.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=4, fig.width=8.5}
x <- rnorm(1000, mean=5, sd=3)

f <- function(x, mu, sigma){
  n <- length(x)
  (1/(sqrt(2*pi)*sigma))^n*exp(-0.5*sum( ((x-mu)/sigma)^2 ))
}


```
